A browser extension that replaces the old regime flag with the flag of the Syrian revolution.

## Credits

The revolution flag image used in this extension was created by [Mayas on emoji.gg](https://emoji.gg/user/mayas).

## About This Flag

While Syria's future governance remains to be determined at the time of this extension's creation, the revolution flag represents the aspirations and dreams of free Syrians. It stands as a symbol of the Syrian people's struggle for liberty and dignity, and honors the immense sacrifices made over many years in the pursuit of a free Syria.
